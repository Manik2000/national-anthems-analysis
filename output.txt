Against the humiliating bondage of a thousand years Rapacity came from afar to subjugate them for a hundred years. Against the cynical malice in the shape Of neo-colonialism and its petty local servants. Many gave in and certain others resisted. But the frustrations, the successes, the sweat, the blood Have fortified our courageous people and fertilized its heroic struggle.  And one single night has drawn together The history of an entire people, And one single night has launched its triumphal march. Towards the horizon of good fortune. One single night has brought together our people With all the peoples of the World, In the acquisition of liberty and progress. Motherland or death, we shall conquer. Nourished in the lively source of the Revolution, The volunteers for liberty and peace With their nocturnal and beneficial energies of the of August Had not only hand arms, but also and above all The flame in their hearts lawfully to free Faso forever from the fetters of those who Here and there were polluting the sacred soul of independence and sovereignty. And seated henceforth in rediscovered dignity, Love and honour partnered with humanity, The people of Burkina sing a victory hymn To the glory of the work of liberation and emancipation. Down with exploitation of man by man! Forward for the good of every man By all men of today and tomorrow, by every man here and always! Popular revolution our nourishing sap. Undying motherhood of progress in the face of man. Eternal hearth of agreed democracy, Where at last national identity has the right of freedom. Where injustice has lost its place forever, And where from the hands of builders of a glorious world Everywhere the harvests of patriotic vows ripen and suns of boundless joy shine.

Let us salute the motherland, Proud to be called her children. To her well-being let us swear Boldly and unceasingly to devote our lives.

Of peace enjoyed in perfect happiness, El Salvador has always nobly dreamed. To achieve this has been her eternal proposition, To keep it, her greatest glory. With inviolable faith, she eagerly follows The way of progress In order to fulfil her high destiny And achieve a happy future. A stern barrier protects her Against the clash of vile disloyalty, Ever since the day when her lofty banner, In letters of blood, wrote Freedom, Wrote Freedom, wrote Freedom. Freedom is her dogma and her guide; A thousand times she has defended it, And as many times has she repelled The hateful power of atrocious tyranny. Her history has been bloody and sad, Yet at the same time sublime and brilliant, A source of legitimate glory And a great lesson in Spartan pride. Her innate bravery shall not waver In every man there is an immortal hero Who knows how to maintain the level Of the proverbial valour of old. Valour of old, valour of old. All are self-denying and faithful To the tradition of warlike ardour With which they have always reaped fame By saving the motherlands honour. To respect the rights of others And base her actions on right and justice Is for her, without infamous intrigue, The constant and most firm ambition. And in following this line she persists, Dedicating her tenacious efforts In giving hard battle for battle; Her happiness is found in peace, Is found in peace, is found in peace.
Bolivians, a most favorable destiny has at long last crowned our vows and longings; This land is free, free at last. Its servile state has now finally ceased.

Are followed today, in harmonious contrast, by sweet hymns of peace and unity.  Let us keep the lofty name of our country in glorious splendor. And, on its altars, once more we must swear to die before we would live as slaves. To die before we would live as slaves. To die before we would live as slaves. Eternal praise to the brave warriors whose heroic valor and firmness conquered the freedom and glories that now a happy Bolivia justly begins to enjoy! Let their names, preserved forever in marble and bronze, transmit their glory to remote future ages. And in resounding song let them repeat their simple call Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! And in resounding song let them repeat their simple call Freedom! Freedom! Freedom! Here has Justice erected its Throne which vile oppression ignores and, on its glorious stamp let us rejoice Freedom, freedom, freedom This innocent and beautiful land, which owes its name to Bolívar, is the happy homeland where mankind enjoys the benefits of good fortune and peace. Is the happy homeland where mankind enjoys the benefits of good fortune and peace. If a foreigner may, any given day even attempt to subjugate Bolivia, let him prepare for a fatal destiny, which menaces such brave aggressor. For the sons of the mighty Bolívar have sworn, thousands upon thousands of times, to die rather than see the countrys majestic banner humiliated. To die rather than see the countrys majestic banner humiliated.
Oh, say can you see by the dawns early light What so proudly we hailed at the twilights last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars thru the perilous fight, Oer the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof thru the night that our flag was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave Oer the land of the free and the home of the brave? On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep, Where the foes haughty host in dread silence reposes, What is that which the breeze, oer the towering steep, As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the mornings first beam, In full glory reflected now shines in the stream Tis the star-spangled banner! Oh long may it wave Oer the land of the free and the home of the brave. And where is that band who so vauntingly swore That the havoc of war and the battles confusion, A home and a country should leave us no more! Their blood has washed out of their foul footsteps pollution. No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight and the gloom of the grave And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave Oer the land of the free and the home of the brave. Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand Between their loved home and the wars desolation! Blest with victory and peace, may the heavn rescued land Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation. Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, And this be our motto In God is our trust. And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave Oer the land of the free and the home of the brave.
For three centuries a reign oppressed The unhappy peoples of America, But one day, their anger aroused, they said An end to this! and broke the reign. Our forefathers, fighting magnificently, Displayed their martial glory, And when the august diadem was shattered, They raised the triumphal cap of liberty.  Paraguayans, Republic or death! It was our strength that gave us our final liberty. Neither tyrants nor slaves can continue, Where unity and equality reign, Where unity and equality reign. A new Rome, the Fatherland shall proudly display Two leaders of name and valor Who, rivals, like Romulus and Remus Divided government and power. Long years, during which Phoebus in the clouds Saw darken the pearl of the South, Today a grand hero appears Raising up again her glory and virtue Europe and the world salute her with applause And also acclaim Invincible bastion of heroism, Magnificent Eden of riches. But when discord rumbled all around Which fatally devoured other Peoples, Paraguayans, the sacred ground Was covered by an angel with its wings. Oh, how pure, of laurel girded Sweet Fatherland, in this manner you show yourself. In your ensign one sees the colors Of sapphire, diamond, and ruby. In your coat of arms, which the Sun illuminates, Under the cap, one sees the lion. Double image of the strong and the free, And of glories, the memory and crest. From the tomb of vile feudalism The national Deity rises free; Oppressors, bend your knees! Compatriots, entone the hymn! Sound the cry, Republic or death! Our breasts exhale it with faith, And the mountains repeat its echoes Like giants arising. Our Fatherland defends liberty and justice; Tyrants listen! The laws in its sacred charter Will sustain its heroism in the fight. Against the world, if the world opposes it, If the world dares to insult her security, Battling to avenge we shall know her Or die embracing her. Arise, oh People, your splendid sword That strikes with sparkles of God, There is no middle ground between free or slave And an abyss divides the two. In the gentle breezes the Hymn resounds, Repeating with triumphal echo For the free, renowned glory! For the Fatherland, immortal laurel!
O sons of the Sahara! In the battlefield, you are torch holders in the long road Make revolution in our nation and follow this path for her sake. Cut off the head of the invader. Cut off the head of the invader. O revolutionaries, the homeland will be glorious. Cut off the estates in this region. Remove in war the causes for protest and abandon it; no submission, no yielding. No agent, no invader, no agent, no invader. You who ask about us we are the ones who drive the transforming struggle. We are the ones who smash that idol, we are the ones who understand the beautiful lesson. We are the people of the path; we are the people of the path. We are the ones who revealed the path against the raid, the one that burns up the raiders. It is the war to erase the oppressor and establish the right of the laborers. We are the people of the path; We are the people of the path. The uprising is for the people and will advance in the Arab lands. It will produce unity forever in the hearts and will establish justice and democracy. Every century, every generation, every century, every generation.

O sweet Saint Martins Land So bright by beach and strand With sailors on the sea and harbors free Where the chains of mountains green Variously in sunshine sheen Oh I love thy Paradise, Nature beauty fairly nice Oh I love thy Paradise, Nature beauty fairly nice How pretty between all green Flamboyants beaming gleam Of flowers red by sunlight set Thy cows and sheep and goats In meadows or on the roads Thy donkeys keen I cant forget Thy useful birds in white Their morn and evening flight Like aircrafts-wings in unity Their coming down for food Then turning back to roost Bring home to me their harmony Saint Martin I like thy name In which Columbus fame And memories of old are closed For me a great delight Thy Southern Cross the night May God the Lord protect thy coast!

In my heart theres a call for the isles far away Where the wind from the Horn often wanders at play. Where the kelp moves and swells to the wind and the tide And penguins troop down from the lonely hillside.  Those isles of the sea are calling to me The smell of the camp fire a dear memory. Though far I may roam, some day Ill come home To the islands, the Falklands, the isles of the sea. Theres a camp house down yonder Im longing to see, Though its no gilded palace its there I would be. Just to be there again I would race oer the foam, For that lone house so far is my own home sweet home. Now were off to the Falklands, so wild and so free, Where theres tussock and kelp and the red diddle-dee, And the wild rugged beauty that thrills more than me Is bred in the bones on the isles of the sea.
Sons and daughters of Saint Lucia Love the land that gave us birth. Land of beaches, hills and valleys, Fairest isle of all the earth. Wheresoever you may roam, Love, oh love, our island home. Gone the days when nations battled For this Helen of the West. Gone the days when strife and discord, Dimmed her childrens toil and rest. Dawns at last a brighter day, Stretches out a glad new way. May the Good Lord bless our island; Guard her sons from woe and harm. May our people, live united, Strong in soul and strong in arm. Justice, truth and charity, Our ideals forever be.
My island lies oer the ocean; Like a wreath of flowers upon the sea; With a light of Mekar from far above; Shining with the brilliance of rays of life;.

Dear, verdant island, set in blue Caribbean Sea, Im coming, coming very soon, O beautious isle, to thee. Although I wandered far, My heart enshrines thee yet. Homeland, fair Cayman Isle, I cannot thee forget. Away from noise of cities, Their fret and carking care, With moonbeams soft caresses, Unchecked by garish glare, Thy fruit with rarest juices, Abundant, rich and free, When sweet church bells are chiming, My fond heart yearns for thee. When tired of all excitement And glamrous worldly care, How sweet thy shores to reach And find a welcome there, And when comes on the season Of peace, goodwill to man, Tis then I love thee best of all, Beloved Isle, Cayman.
The land of thousand islands and skerries, Born from deep beneath the waves Åland, our Åland, our home it is Thee we long to meet Ancient graves beneath the birches Tells of our thousand year history We will never forget the land of our Fathers No matter where we will go No matter where we will go Lovely is our Åland when bays and straits Become blue in the bright days of spring Its delightful to wander in forest and grove In the flowered fields of our shores. Midsummer pole to evening red sky Is raised by willing hands Farthest out in the skerry fisher village Beacons are lit by the young Beacons are lit by the young Lovely is our Åland when the froth of waves is whirling against the mighty precipice When the church folks steer beneath the stars Over the icy depths of the sea Even when storm roars, in the cottages peace The song of the spinning wheel is sung The memory of loving childhood is Happily praised by the sons Happily praised by the sons Never have Alandian women and men Let the honour of their tribe down Warfare threatened us, but victoriously yet We carry the heritage of freedom Loudly shall it sound, our Swedish language Spoken with an urging voice Enlighten our path like a sea mark of flames Show us where we belong Show us where we belong
